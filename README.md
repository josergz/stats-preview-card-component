## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- SASS
- flexbox

### What I learned

With this challenge you can test my skills, I tried to use the correct semantics of html, using sass I declared color variables that I used throughout the project, finally with flexbox I worked to accommodate the elements and to show the mobile version.

### Continued development

These challenges help me to continue developing my skills in html and css, I am currently learning javascript.

### Useful resources

- [Mediaquery](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/layout/overview/) - This helped me breakpoint for responsive design.
- [Flexbox](https://www.aluracursos.com/blog/flexbox-css-guia-completo-elementos-y-exemples) - This is a web page that serves as a guide for flexbox, it has explanations and examples. I would recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
